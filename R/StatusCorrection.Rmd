```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```
Inspiration: ForestData::correct_alive() and .correct_alive_tree()

Return: Create the 'LifeStatusCor' column and fill the 'Comment' column

- if UseSize : if DBH != NA -> Alive
- [*Dead* > Alive] -> NA
- add rows for the forgotten censuses between 2 'Alive'
- [Alive > *Dead*/*NA* > Alive] -> Alive
- [Alive > *NA* > Dead] -> NA
- [Alive > *Dead* > NA] -> Dead

- [Alive > *NA* > *NA*]:
if DeathConfirmation > unseens -> NA
if DeathConfirmation =< unseens -> Dead

}
```

### Use the size presence as a witness of the living status of the tree
```{r}
if(UseSize){
  
  DataTree <- GenerateComment(DataTree,
                              condition = !is.na(DataTree[, DBH]) &

                              comment = "A measured tree is a living tree")
  
  
  if(DetectOnly %in% FALSE){
    DataTree[!is.na(DBH), LifeStatusCor := TRUE] # c'est tout ? une taille = vivant ? non ya encore des corrections possibles !!
  }
  
}else{
  
  if(DetectOnly %in% FALSE){
    DataTree[, LifeStatusCor := LifeStatus] # we will work on a new col and keep the original col intact
  }
}
```

### Sequence analyse
```{r}
# if tree has ever been recorded alive
if(any(DataTree$LifeStatus %in% TRUE)){
  # The first tree life status in the dataset
  # FirstStatus <- DataTree[CensusYear == min(CensusYear), LifeStatus]
  
  # The first and last Alive record year
  FirstAliveYear <- min(DataTree[LifeStatus %in% TRUE, CensusYear])
  # LastAliveYear <- max(DataTree[LifeStatus %in% TRUE, CensusYear])
  
  # Before/between positions (rows id)
  FirstAlive <- which(DataTree$LifeStatus %in% TRUE)[1] # the 1st seen alive
  LastAlive <-  max(which(DataTree$LifeStatus %in% TRUE)) # the last seen alive
  
  # Before <- which(DataTree$CensusYear < FirstAliveYear) # Before the first alive
  # Between <- which(DataTree$CensusYear > FirstAliveYear & DataTree$CensusYear < LastAliveYear) # Between the fist and last alive
}
```

### Absents (logical vector of the Censuses length)
```{r}
# if tree has ever been recorded dead
if(any(DataTree$LifeStatus %in% FALSE)){
  # The last time where the tree has been recorded dead (in case there are several)
  LastDeathRecord <- max(DataTree[LifeStatus %in% FALSE, CensusYear])
  
  After <- which(DataTree$CensusYear > LastDeathRecord) # After the last death record
  
  # If there is any "Alive" report after last reported death
  if(any(DataTree$LifeStatus[After] %in% TRUE)) {
    # Absents are the absent record years among the plot censuses from the 1st alive record
    Absents <- (Censuses > FirstAliveYear & !Censuses %in% DataTree$CensusYear)
    
  }else{
    # Absents are the absent record years between first alive record and the last death record
    Absents <- (Censuses > FirstAliveYear &
                  Censuses < LastDeathRecord & # death = the end 
                  !Censuses %in% DataTree$CensusYear)
  }
  
}else{ # if tree has not been reported dead yet
  
  # Absents are the absent record years among the plot censuses from the 1st alive record
  Absents <- (Censuses > FirstAliveYear & !Censuses %in% DataTree$CensusYear)
  
}

Absents <- (!Censuses %in% DataTree$CensusYear)

# En DetectOnly, je renvoie qqchose ? quoi ? ########

```

### Function to fill in the invariant columns in the added rows
```{r}
FillinInvariantColumns <- function(NewRow, InvariantColumns, DataTree, IdTree){
  
  for(j in InvariantColumns){
    
    if(any(is.na(NewRow[,get(j)]))){ # if the column is empty in the new rows (the "absent" trees)
      
      uni <- unique(DataTree[, get(j)])
      
      if(length(uni) > 1){ # if the "invariant column is not invariant
        stop("The variable ",
             j,
             " that you defined as a non-varying column -i.e. supposed to have always the same value for each measurement of the same tree- has multiple values for tree ",
             IdTree,
             " and takes the values ",
             uni)
      }
      else if(length(uni) == 0){ # no value in the invariant column
        stop("The variable ",j," has no value for individual ",IdTree)
      }
      else{
        NewRow[is.na(get(j)), (j) := uni] # fill the invariant columns in NewRow with their (unique) value
      }
    }
  }
  
  return(NewRow)
}

```

### Creating rows for absents
```{r}

    NewNames <- names(NewRow)
    
    if(length(InvariantColumns) > 0){ # if there are invariant columns
      
      NewRow[,(InvariantColumns) := NA] # empty the invariant columns for the added rows
      
      # Fill in the invariant columns in the added rows
